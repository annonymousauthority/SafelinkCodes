# SafelinkCodes
Code base for my swiftui sample projects

ğŸ¥… The goal is to create different sample sections of an ios app
The folder breakdown is as follows:

* -- Splash Screen (Looking Glass Production)

* -- 2X Onboarding Screens

* -- 3X Animation Challenge 

* -- 4X Home Page

# Usage 

* Clone Repo to local machine
* In the ContentView file, replace body view with corresponding sample views from any sample folders 
 > I promise you don't have to do any configuration (hopefully ğŸ˜…)
